1. Project Evaluation Method

   1. **NPV**. Accept a project if the NPV is greater than zero. Reject a project if NPV is less than zero.
   2. **The Payback Period Method**. A particular cutoff date, say two years, is selected. All investment projects that have payback periods of two years or less are accepted, and all of those that pay off in more than two years—if at all—are rejected.
   3. **The Discounted Payback Period Method**. we first discount the cash flows. Then we ask how long it takes for the discounted cash flows to equal the initial
      investment.

2. Incremental Cash Flows

   - Incremental cash flow is the potential increase or decrease in a company's cash flow related to the acceptance of a new project or investment in a new asset.

   - Positive incremental cash flow is a good sign that the investment is more profitable to the company than the expenses it will incur.

   - Incremental cash flow can be a good tool to assess whether to invest in a new project or asset, but it should not be the only resource for assessing the new venture.

   - Cash flow from operations + total cash flow of the investment = total cash flow of the project
     - Cash flow from operations = sales - both operating costs and taxes = Net profit + Depreciation

3. Risk Analysis on Determining Sales

   1. **Sensitivity Analysis**. A sensitivity analysis determines how *different values* of an independent variable *affect a particular dependent variable* under a given set of assumptions. 

      - e.g. Pessimistic, Expected, and Optimistic situation with probability 

   2. **Scenario Analysis**. It examines a number of different likely scenarios, where each scenario involves a confluence of factors.

      - e.g. The effect of a few airline crashes.

   3. **Break-even Analysis**. It determines the sales needed to break even.

      - Present Value BE point:
